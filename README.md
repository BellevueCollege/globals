# Bellevue College Globals
Globals is Bellevue College's unified style and reusable content library. Globals is deployed across all production and test webservers.

## Developer setup
As of version 3.10, Globals depends on NPM/Gulp for dependency management.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer (needed for npm)
   * *Mac:* If you have Homebrew installed, try `brew install node`
2. From the command line, `cd` to the repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies
   * *Windows:* It is recommended that you use Command Prompt or PowerShell (not Git Bash)
3. Install Gulp globally so that your commands work- `npm install -g gulp`
4. The following commands will now be available:
   * `gulp` - Compiles for production
   * `gulp dev` - Compiles for dev
   * `gulp watch` - Watches for changes in SCSS files, and compiles to CSS (does not do other operations)

Other commands are available for specific operations, but these are run as part of `gulp` or `gulp dev`.
Commands are all configured in [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js). Dependencies (and versions) are listed in [package.json](package.json).

As of version 3.15, gulp commands should be run from the source folder of the globals version you are compiling. For example, to compile a new version of globals 3, you would go to `./src/3/` and then run `gulp`.
