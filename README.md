# Bellevue College Globals
Globals is Bellevue College's unified style and reusable content library. Globals is deployed across all production and test web servers.

## Versions
### Globals 2 ‚Äî **‚ùå Deprecated**  
Based on [Bootstrap 2](https://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/), Globals 2 was our first Bootstrap-based version of Globals. Globals 2 does not use any build framework, and exists entirely within the `/g/2/` directory.

### Globals 3 ‚Äî **üî∂ Production - Deprecated**  
Based on [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/), Globals 3 is our current primary framework for public-facing sites. Globals 3 uses the [Bootstrap Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) official fork of Bootstrap 3, with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) being used as a build system.

**Deprecated**: While Globals 3 is still maintained, any new projects should be built on Globals 4, and older projects should be converted where possible.

## Developer setup
Globals 3 and 4 depend on NPM and Gulp for dependency and build management.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your computer (needed for npm)
   * *Mac:* If you have Homebrew installed, try `brew install node`
2. From the command line, `cd` to the repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies
   * *Windows:* It is recommended that you use Command Prompt or PowerShell (not Git Bash)
3. Install Gulp globally so that your commands work- `npm install gulp-cli -g`
4. The following commands will now be available from within `/src/3` and `/src/4`:
   * `gulp` - Compiles for production
   * `gulp dev` - Compiles for dev
   * `gulp watch` - Watches for changes in SCSS files, and compiles to CSS and JS.

Commands are all configured in [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js). Dependencies (and versions) are listed in [package.json](package.json). Note that Gulp is configured separately for Globals 3 and 4, but package management is centralized.

**Example Commands**

```bash
cd src/4
gulp watch
```
