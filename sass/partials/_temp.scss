/* 
# Why dooes this file exist?

Some changes to Globals require changing or moving css within other projects,
like Mayflower, Mayflower Homepage, etc. Unfortionatly browser caching and release
schedules can prevent these changes from being available to the public in sync with
globals releases.

That's where this file comes in! The code here is temporary, and should always be 
duplicated in another project. It lives here as a patch only, and should generally
be removed on the next major release!

As a style, all css blocks in this file should be commented with the following:

* Project the code is from
* Date which code was added
